# Nadex Project Roadmap

This document outlines potential future enhancements and known issues for the Nadex application. It is a living document that can be updated as new ideas emerge.

## Future Enhancements

-   **Advanced Filtering:** Introduce more granular filtering options, such as by side (CT/T), or specific grenade types within a category.
-   **Strat Book Feature:** Allow users to group multiple nade lineups into a "strat." This would enable creating, saving, and viewing coordinated team strategies (e.g., "A-Site Execute on Mirage").
-   **Interactive Maps with Callouts:**
    -   Display a top-down view of the selected map with standard callout locations marked.
    -   Potentially allow opening this map in a separate, resizable window for reference.
-   **Sharing System:** Create a system for users to export their nades/strats (e.g., to a single file) and import them into another user's Nadex application.
-   **App Icon:** Create an icon for the application.

## Known Issues & Areas for Improvement
- **Auto-update:** Auto-update is not working.
